    "In FM Synthesis, two sinusoids are combined such that one of them modulates the instantaneous frequency of the other one.  If the modulating sinusoid is $\\sin(2 \\pi f_m  t)$ (where its frequency is  $f_m$) then the output signal x(t) is\n",
    "$$x(t) = \\sin\\left( 2 \\pi f_c t + m \\ \\sin(2 \\pi f_m  t)\\right)$$\n",
    "where $f_c$ is the frequency of the sinusoid being modulated and $m$ is the modulation index describing the degree of modulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematics of frequency modulation tell us the the resulting frequency spectrum will be a line at the frequency $f_c$ and other lines spaced integer multiples of $f_m$ away from $f_c$ where the amplitude of the line $n$ multiples away from $f_c$ will equal $J_n(m)$ where the function $J_n(x)$ is a \"Bessel Function of the First Kind\".  Hence, the combination of these two sinusoids will create a spectrum with mutliple lines it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, in cases where $m$ is large enough so that audible lines pass into negative frequencies, they are perceived as having positive frequency and so frequency lines that are no longer multiples of $f_m$ away from $f_c$ appear in the spectrum, allowing for very complex sounds.  (For example, if $f_c$ were $1 kHz$ and $f_m$ were $300 Hz$ then, in addition to the possibility of lines at \\{$100Hz, 400Hz, 700Hz, 1kHz, 1.3kHz, ...\\}, the negative frequencies could mix in lines at \\{200Hz, 500Hz, 800Hz, 1.1 kHz, ...\\}.  Hence, FM Synthesis allows for the creation of very complex sounds from only two oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The widgets below allow you to set the key FM Synthesis parameters $f_c, f_m, m$ and then both listen to the result and see its frequency spectrum.  "
